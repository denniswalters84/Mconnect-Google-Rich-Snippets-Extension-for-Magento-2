<p>The world around us is evolving and in this digital age, the online shopping has also evolved. Any person on the internet can shop any product in just a few clicks. And the search engines like Google provide an efficient way for customers to find and shop online. There is no better search engine than Google because it alone performs 5.5 billion search queries in a day. But you must be on the top of the SERPs of Google in your niche for taking full benefit. Google search engine crawlers or bots indexes your site and fetches information to show on SERPs. And there are rich snippets that will display meaningful information in the most structured way. Rich snippets like price, rating, availability, and others encourage customers to visit your site. So, it is essential that you add such rich snippet/structured data on your store&rsquo;s most product pages.</p>
